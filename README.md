# Velodyne-Lidar-Segmentation-Clustering-and-Distance-Measurement-at-PCL
First 3D Velodyne lidar is used with Point Cloud Library (PCL). Then, Segmentation and Clustering is processed. Finally, distance is calculated at 3d coordinate frame for each object. After, i will plan to boxing of each object.
